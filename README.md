# Detection of Network Attacks in SIEM

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate network attacks and detect them using a SIEM Solution. The setup includes a combination of **Wazuh, Suricata, tcpdump** to monitor and analyze network activity.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Simulate various network attacks using **Kali Linux**.
- Detect malicious activity with **Suricata** and log it in **Wazuh**.
- Analyze security events in the SIEM dashboard.
- Use **tcpdump** to capture and inspect traffic for deeper analysis.
- Ensure accurate timestamps with **Chrony (NTP)**.
- Create and fine-tune **custom Wazuh rules**
- (Optional) Implement a **Telegram bot** for alerting.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **tcpdump** â€“ Packet capture.
- **Python** â€“ For script of Telegram bot.
- **Suricata** â€“ NIDS to analyze traffic and detect potential attacks.
- **Wazuh SIEM** â€“ Log collection and alerting.
- **Chrony (NTP)** - Time synchronization
